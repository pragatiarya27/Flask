This REST API allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete user data using Flask. User records are stored in an in-memory Python dictionary. Each user is identified by a unique ID. It supports standard HTTP methods: POST (create), GET (read), PUT (update), and DELETE (remove). This is a basic prototype ideal for local testing or learning REST concepts.It stores user information in an in-memory dictionary, assigning each user a unique ID automatically. The API communicates using JSON format, allowing external clients to send and receive user data via HTTP requests. It provides clear endpoints for adding new users, retrieving individual user details, updating existing records, and deleting users. While simple, this API is ideal for learning REST principles and can be extended later with features like database integration, authentication, and input validation for real-world use.
